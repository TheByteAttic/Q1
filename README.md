# Q1 microcomputer
In this repository, which I'll populate over time as a reverse-engineer the machine, you can find information about Q1-Lite-IWS microcomputers. The Q1 microcomputers, released first in December of 1972, were the first fully-integrated desktop computers to contain a microprocessor for CPU (instead of discrete TTL logic). As such, they were the world's first true microcomputers, years before the MITS Altair 8800.

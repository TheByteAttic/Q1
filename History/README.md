This folder contains various bits of information on the history of Q1 machines. The highlight is Daniel Alroy's story (Daniel was the founder and president of Q1 corporation). Some of the information here has been scanned by the Technikum29 computer museum in Germany (<a href="https://technikum29.de/">https://technikum29.de/</a>). The ad about the Q1 Basic Office Machine shows a prototype that never went into production. In the words of Karl Wacker, who worked at Q1 at the time, "I'm attaching a picture that I found over the weekend while going over Daniel Alroy's papers with his daughter Daphne: This is a photo of a product that was prototyped while I was still working at Q1, and would have been remarkable if it had been able to go into production. The thermal printer was a bit too hard to get working consistently due to the multi-segmented thermal print head, and since the only small non-mechanical memory at the time was bubble memory, I suspect these limitations doomed it." Thanks to Karl and Daniel Alroy's daughter, Daphne Alroy, for the photos of the original Q1 system, the world's first microcomputer.
